			<p>
				I am a software engineer that has skills in both the back-end of web applications and
				the front-end. My previous career as a math engineer brought me close to my true
				passion: coding. I wasnâ€™t satisfied with only being involved in automating and
				data analyzing , and wanted a deeper involvement in building out applications.
				In the next phase of my career, I not only want to work on the technically challenging
				facets of the application, but I also want to use my design skills to make
				the application look beautiful too. I seek a role as a web developer at a company
				where I follow best practices like Test Driven Development and pair programming
				to help me learn and grow as a developer, and continue to master the craft.
